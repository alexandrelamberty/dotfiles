The dotfiles are split into 2 categories, `common` and `exclusive`. The
`common` are shared across multiple installation and the `exclusive` are for
specific configuration, computers.

## TODO

- [ ] Split this configuration into git branches? 
- [ ] Refactor installation from Stow to custom?
- [ ] Clean fonts, add wallpapers, icons and sounds
- [ ] Check for security issues, mutt and others need credential
